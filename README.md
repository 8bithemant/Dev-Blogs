## How to contribute?

1. Hit the fork button to create a copy of the repo on your account.

2. Navigate to your version and copy the clone url. A little like this:

   - https://github.com/YourUserName/Dev-Blogs.git

3. Clone locally with `git clone https://github.com/yourname/Dev-Blogs.git`

4. Change into the local version `cd DEV_BLOGS`

5. Add an upstream remote -> `git remote add upstream https://github.com/8bithemant/Dev-Blogs.git`

   - The upstream origin points to the original and origin points to your forked version

6. Now get it working locally:
   `npm i && npm start`
   or
   `yarn && yarn start`

   - This will install dependencies and start the react server

7. Make the changes

8. Add the changes to another branch:

   ```
   git checkout master
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git pull upstream master && git push -u origin master
   git checkout -b hotfix/name-of-change
   ```

9. Now create the pull request: `git push -u origin hotfix/name-of-change`
